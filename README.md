Customizable 6 Degrees of Freedom Grasping Dataset and an Interactive Training Method for Graph Convolutional Network

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our research on Customizable 6 Degrees of Freedom Grasping Dataset and an Interactive Training Method for Graph Convolutional Network.

## Highlights

1. **Data Generator:** Propose an innovative method for generating robotic grasping datasets which simulates real-life robotic gripper actions in a virtual setting instead of relying on manual annotations.

2. **End-to-end graph convolution network:** Design an end-to-end graph convolution grasping prediction network, which can directly predict the optimal grasping points and orientations from partial point cloud.
   
3. **Interactive training method:** Introduce an interactive training method which reforms training style of deep learning models by allowing real-time adjustments to both the training data and model's training hyperparameters.
